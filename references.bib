abstract = {Providing leisure to people with dementia is a serious challenge, for health care professionals and designers and engineers of products used for activity sessions. This article describes the design process of ''the Chitchatters,'' a leisure game for a group of people with dementia in day care centers. The game aims to stimulate social interaction among people with dementia. Different stakeholders, such as older adults with dementia, their relatives and care professionals were involved in the design process via qualitative research methods as participant observation and the use of probes. These methods were applied to give the design team insight into the experiential world of people with dementia. This article presents how design insights from practice and literature can be translated into a real design for a leisure product for group use by older people with dementia, and shows designers how to work with, and design for, special groups.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A "smart home" is a residence wired with technology features that monitor the well-being and activities of their residents to improve overall quality of life, increase independence and prevent emergencies. This type of informatics applications targeting older adults, people with disabilities or the general population is increasingly becoming the focus of research worldwide. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of health related smart home projects and discuss human factors and other challenges.

METHODS: To cover not only the medical but also the social sciences and electronics literature, we conducted extensive searches across disciplines (e.g., Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Electronics and Communications Abstracts, Web of Science etc.). In order to be inclusive of all new initiatives and efforts in this area given the innovativeness of the concept, we manually searched for relevant references in the retrieved articles as well as published books on smart homes and gerontechnology.

RESULTS: A total of 114 publications (including papers, abstracts and web pages) were identified and reviewed to identify the overarching projects. Twenty one smart home projects were identified (71\% of the projects include technologies for functional monitoring, 67\% for safety monitoring, 47\% for physiological monitoring, 43\% for cognitive support or sensory aids, 19\% for monitoring security and 19\% to increase social interaction). Evidence for their impact on clinical outcomes is lacking.

CONCLUSIONS: The field of smart homes is a growing informatics domain. Several challenges including not only technical but also ethical ones need to be addressed.},

abstract = {MINWii is a music therapy game for the renarcissization of demented patients. It lets players improvise or play songs of their choice by pointing at a virtual keyboard with a Wiimote Pistol. We present the results of a three-month usability study we conducted with 7 institutionalized patients suffering from mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease at the LUSAGE Living Lab in Paris. We demonstrate that MINWii is indeed usable by AD patients despite their motor and cognitive impairments: our results, which were largely computed automatically thanks to MINWii's extensive logging capabilities, show either an instant mastery or a clear learning effect depending on patients' cognitive abilities. Moreover, patients were overall very satisfied with the game and expressed a desire to repeat the experience: MINWii fosters positive interaction with the caregivers and elicits powerful reminiscence with even the most severely impaired patients. This study justifies future research to assess the lasting effects of playing MINWii on both quality of life and cognitive impairment in demented patients.},

abstract = {The number of older Americans afflicted by Alzheimer disease and related dementias will triple to 13 million persons by 2050, thus greatly increasing healthcare needs. An approach to this emerging crisis is the development and deployment of intelligent assistive technologies that compensate for the specific physical and cognitive deficits of older adults with dementia, and thereby also reduce caregiver burden. The authors conducted an extensive search of the computer science, engineering, and medical databases to review intelligent cognitive devices, physiologic and environmental sensors, and advanced integrated sensor networks that may find future applications in dementia care. Review of the extant literature reveals an overwhelming focus on the physical disability of younger persons with typically nonprogressive anoxic and traumatic brain injuries, with few clinical studies specifically involving persons with dementia. A discussion of the specific capabilities, strengths, and limitations of each technology is followed by an overview of research methodological challenges that must be addressed to achieve measurable progress to meet the healthcare needs of an aging America.},

A total of 60 transcripts of interview style conversations were analyzed using a discourse analysis schema. The results revealed a higher frequency of discourse building features, such as coherence and cohesion, for healthy adults compared to adults with dementia. Conversely, discourse-impairing features, such as disruptive topic shifts and empty phrases, were found more often in conversations of adults with dementia compared to healthy adults. Conversational partners deviated from their conversation protocol when talking to adults with dementia by including facilitative strategies in the conversation. Discourse features in interview style conversations in adults with dementia reflect declines in their memory. "
